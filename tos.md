Third party applications or sites that use our services are allowed but always have to implement the following text somewhere:

# For websites
"This website is not run by or affiliated with Alpha Blend Interactive (abinteractive.net) in any way."

# For applications
"This application is not created by or affiliated with Alpha Blend Interactive (abinteractive.net) in any way."

# For communities
"This community is not created by or affiliated with Alpha Blend Interactive (abinteractive.net) in any way."

# Account management
Account bans can only be appealed by using the support system in the community hub linked above. Messages on the Discord or e-mails for unban requests will be ignored.
All appeals will be checked by 2 team members that did not issue the warning or ban before. This is done to ensure that a case can be double checked against the community guidelines.
In accordance with the EU GDPR regulations we offer you collected data packages and account deletions. This can be requested in the community hub.
Account deletions do not delete account bans. Creating a new account in this case will still count as ban evasion and is a bannable offense.
You can only appeal a ban once. One second chance is granted in most cases. If you appeal a ban and your appeal is denied, you will not be able to appeal again.
The team of Alpha Blend Interactive has the permission to terminate accounts without rule violations to protect other players if a danger for other players is possible.
All sanctions, warnings and bans are shown on the public community profiles.
