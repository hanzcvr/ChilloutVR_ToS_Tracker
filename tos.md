# The Platform
To play ChilloutVR and/or use related services, you must be at least 13 years of age or older.
Ban evasion is not permitted. You may appeal your bans using the above-mentioned support contact or - if available - on the community hub. Any ban evasion, regardless of the ban duration or time of account creation, will result in a permanent ban of all accounts involved without appeal.
In order to protect the safety, integrity, and functionality of the platform and its users, our moderation and security teams reserve the right to take appropriate action - including account suspension - even in cases where no explicit rule has been violated, but user behavior poses a risk to the community or the platform’s operation.
Usage of temporary mail accounts is not permitted. Any account registered under a trashmail/throwaway email or temporary account will be permanently suspended or deleted without any notice.
Profile pictures must always be safe for work (not contain explicit or adult-only references or material).

# Social Interactions
You may never expose any other user to any sort of hate speech, harassment or disrespectful behavior, regardless of the form of exposure.
You may never expose any other user to any sort of discrimination, including but not limited to spiritual beliefs, genders, sexual orientation or any other personally identifying factors.
You may never approach another user with the intent to disturb, insult, annoy or upset.
You may never organize, run, manage or be involved with hate groups in any way whatsoever.
You may never expose any user under the age of 18 or the age of majority (outlined in §2.6) to any sort of adult-only or explicit content, regardless of instance type.
Adult-only activities and/or wearing [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) clothing is only permitted in private instance types. Please ensure that your avatar has appropriate default options if you wish to use it in public instance types.
You may only access adult-only and explicit content within the game if you have reached the age of majority according to your jurisdiction and are at least 18 years old. If you are 18 years old but are not legally allowed to access the content based on your jurisdiction, we would still consider you not permitted to access it.
You may never gain access to [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) parts of the game if you have not met the requirement defined in 2.6. Doing so may result in a permanent suspension with no option to appeal. This also applies to the Steam Mature Content Access DLC.
Individuals or groups hosting any [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) events are required to verify the age of all parties involved before allowing them to participate. Failure to verify the age of members, or take appropriate action in cases where falsified information has been provided, may lead to the host/group owner and/or the non-verified user being permanently suspended.
You may never bypass mature content limitations in any way whatsoever.
Uploaded content may never contain any Child Sexual Abuse material.
You may never play any form of [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) material on a video player in an instance considered to be public.
You may never play disturbing videos, including but not limited to gore and cruelty on a video player.
You may never encourage, organize, or participate in actions intended to target, harass, or ostracize another user. This includes, but is not limited to; the creation, distribution, or promotion of so-called "witch hunts", "blacklists", "ban-on-sight lists", or similar efforts to incite hostility or coordinated negative treatment against a user.

# Creating, Uploading and Publishing Content
When creating content for our platform - regardless of content type - all rules regarding social interactions (§2.X) also apply.
All content you upload to ChilloutVR must apply to one of the following:
- Entirely created by you
- Licensed to you with the permission of sub-licensing the content
- Contain significant changes to the base version of the content (parody, mimic, pastiche).
German and European copyright law applies to all uploaded content, regardless of your location of residence.
You may never upload content without explicit permission, ownership, or a license.
Any sort of theft, including but not limited to theft of registered intellectual property or content (including "ripping"), is forbidden. This explicitly includes content from any source, including ChilloutVR itself.
By uploading content to our platform, you allow us to use, store, and process your files and content. You also give us permission to use your content for marketing purposes (e.g. showing off in trailers, videos, streams).
We will communicate with all legal bodies raising copyright claims for any content uploaded to our platform.
This includes but is not limited to take-down requests from private organizations, government bodies and law firms on behalf of a proven rights holder, given satisfactory evidence is provided.
You may never upload or use any sort of malicious content, including but not limited to intentionally poor-performing content or content intended to "crash" or otherwise break the functionality of the game for yourself or other players.
If such content pertaining to §5.6 is unknowingly created and uploaded to the platform without ill intent, you must immediately cease usage of the content and report the method of creation and any related information if possible.
You may never knowingly omit applicable tags when uploading content to the platform. Content tags are a crucial instrument for our content filtering system. Moderation may issue warnings for mistagging or correct tags on behalf of the users if necessary.
When updating content and adding features requiring a different tag, you are required to change the content tags accordingly. Content tags must match the underlying content at any time.
You may never create, share or publish content with the intent to disturb, annoy or upset.
You may never share [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) content to (or create such for) users under the appropriate age for [adult-only/explicit](content-classification.md) content to be seen/used as outlined in §2.6 and §2.6.1.
You may never modify or replace your nameplate or any of its core features and information with props or avatars, including imitation of the default nameplate with features that are omitted or potentially misconstrued as representing official ranks provided by the ChilloutVR team.
If your avatar or prop hides your nameplate entirely, you must add the "horror" tag to the corresponding avatar or prop.
Worlds may use built-in tools for content creation to create custom nameplates so long as they do not imitate official ChilloutVR team ranks
All public content thumbnails must properly represent the content. Further updates and revisions to public content that change its appearance should keep the thumbnail up-to-date.
Content thumbnail images must always be safe for work (not contain explicit or adult-only references or material) for public avatars.

# Modding Our Game
Mods knowingly degrading the experience for other players as well as those intentionally replacing or removing core features of the base game are not permitted.
When overriding parts of the game's code, you must include a disclaimer in the released source code or description of your mod indicating that parts of the modification's code may be/are owned by the ChilloutVR team if applicable.

In accordance with GDPR regulations, we offer you collected data packages and account deletions. This can be requested in your account settings on the community hub.
You may never delete your account to bypass or circumvent a suspension. Suspensions remain active even after the account was deleted and creating a new account is considered ban evasion and as such remains a bannable offense.

If your gross revenue exceeds the mentioned threshold, you can request permission by mailing us at the address above.
Any sort of corporate usage of the platform requires an enterprise license agreement to be formed. In this case, you must contact us after evaluating the platform but before starting any sort of business operation on it.
