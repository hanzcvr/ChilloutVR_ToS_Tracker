These guidelines help determine appropriate content tagging. While not exhaustive, they outline the consensus on what constitutes Suggestive and/or Explicit content.

# Special Considerations
Exceptions may arise due to content diversity. Always consider complete tagging requirements before concluding exemptions apply.

# Visually Non-Human Avatars in a State of Undress
Visually non-human Avatars are characterized by:
Complete fur/scale coverage (anthropomorphic animals/furries)
Robotic/mechanical design
Non-humanoid body structure (abstract, geometric)
These Avatars are exempt from [Explicit full frontal nudity](#avatar-appearance_1) considerations, unless they have visible genitals, reproductive organs or breasts on female-presenting bodies.
Minimally defined breasts without explicit detail are considered Suggestive.
Rule of thumb: 
Would this be acceptable on a children's cartoon show?
Standard clothing considerations apply to visually non-human Avatars as outlined below.
If in doubt: _tag it_. Better to be overly cautious with potentially Suggestive/Explicit content.

# Suggestive
Content implying sexual themes without explicit material; revealing clothing, romantic interactions, suggestive poses similar to PG-13 movies, music videos, or fashion advertisements.
Suggestive content is not barred from public instance types.

# Avatar Appearance
Revealing Attire (covers intimate areas):
Low-cut tops, mini-skirts, bikinis
Pants/undergarments accentuating buttocks
Form-fitting Clothing (non-accentuating):
Bodysuits, leotards, lingerie
Suggestive Designs:
Imagery depicting suggestive figures/poses

# Avatar Function
Suggestive Animations:
Flirty poses and moves
Suggestive dancing

# Worlds/Props
Worlds and Props follow the same standards as Avatars, including:
Posters with suggestive imagery
Statues/figures in revealing attire

# Explicit
Content showing sexual acts, full nudity with intimate areas visible, or material designed for sexual arousal. This adult-only content would receive R/NC-17 ratings or be restricted on mainstream platforms.
Explicit content is not completely barred from public instances. See [Behaviour Guidelines](behaviour_guidelines.md) for applicable rules.

# Avatar Appearance
Full/Partial Nudity:
Exposed genitalia (penis, sheath, testicles, vagina, anus)
Visible internal genitalia/reproductive organs (due to transparent body)
Exposed nipples on female-presenting bodies
Minimal coverage (bandages, pasties, tape, microkini)
Obscenely Exaggerated Proportions:
Body parts of an intimate/suggestive nature scaled to sizes that lack reasonable proportional balance relative to body structure and become the dominant visual element
Fetish/Bondage Attire:
Collars with explicit tags, ball gags, ring gags
Bondage gear with specific intent for fetish play
Sex toys
Explicit Designs:
Pornographic imagery
Designs highlighting sexual anatomy
Revealing Coverage:
Clearly defined genital bulges/detailing
Transparent clothing exposing intimate areas
Form-fitting attire displaying explicit detail

# Avatar Function
Nudity Toggles:
Clothing removal revealing prohibited anatomy
Sexual Interactions:
Penetration systems
Sexual collider/trigger responses
Explicit Audio:
Sexual sounds (moaning, penetration, orgasm, ejaculation)
Sexual Attachments:
Sex toys, strap-ons
Simulated bodily functions (ejaculation, lactation)

# Worlds/Props
Worlds and Props follow the same standards as Avatars, including:
Sexually Focused Content:
Strip clubs
Pornographic imagery
Sex toys and explicit audio systems
