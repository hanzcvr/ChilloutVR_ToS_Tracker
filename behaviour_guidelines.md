These guidelines outline prohibited behaviour in public instance types. Public instance types are defined as:
Public
Group Public
Friends of Group
Friends of Friends
Group Members Only (if join privacy is set to "Everyone Can Join")
These should be treated as public spaces; all behaviour should align with what is acceptable in public environments.

# Explicit Activities
Explicit behaviour and activities are not permitted in Public Instances. These include but are not limited to:
Physical Exhibition:
Exposing intimate areas
Actively performing, simulating, or participating in sexual activities
Sexual Simulation & Performance:
Using Avatar animations to simulate sexual acts
Positioning Avatars in sexual poses or configurations
Using platform physics or interaction systems for sexual simulation
Broadcasting or streaming sexual activities to other users
Interactive Sexual Behavior:
Engaging in sexual roleplay with other users in public spaces
Using voice chat for sexual content (moaning, dirty talk, sexual sounds)
Requesting sexual acts from other users
Inappropriate Use of Platform Features:
Using hand tracking, haptics, or other input methods to simulate sexual touching
Modifying environments to facilitate public sexual activities
Broadcasting sexual content through screen sharing or media features

# Fetish Exhibition
The active demonstration or performance of fetish activities in public spaces where others can observe. This distinction focuses on behaviour and interaction rather than passive appearance; differentiating between wearing fetish-associated items as personal fashion versus engaging in fetish-related activities or scenarios.
Example: wearing a collar as an accessory versus participating in pet-play activities while collared and leashed.

# Permitted (Not Considered Exhibition):
Wearing fetish-associated clothing/accessories as fashion
Discussing fetishes in appropriate contexts

# Prohibited (Constitutes Exhibition):
Performing fetish acts for others to observe
Requesting others participate in fetish scenarios
Using platform features to simulate fetish activities
Creating scenarios where others become unwilling participants
Broadcasting or demonstrating fetish behaviours in public spaces
Fetish discussions should follow appropriate social context; casual conversation among willing participants is permitted, while unsolicited fetish topics directed at strangers is prohibited.
