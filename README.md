# Methodology
Each major section reduced to a single leading hash/# symbol.
Subsections have their numbering removed.
Spaces between line items in each subsection are removed, with a single space
between each major grouping (anything starting with one or more #).
When major groupings naming changes, the original name is appended before for
that commit to make the git diffs a little cleaner.
Thereafter the original name will be removed, preferring the new name for new commits.
For each commit adding new subsections, they are appended to the end, except in
the case that the new subsections involve splitting off from an existing subsection.
Leading and trailing and doubled whitespace is removed.
The original commit hash, commit message, and commit date are included in each
commit following this one.

# Caveats
This should not be used as a reference to what the current ToS is, but rather is
an attempt to track changes to the ToS over time in a way that's less churny than
the actual repository.

# Usage
To use, click [this link](https://github.com/hanzcvr/ChilloutVR_ToS_Tracker/commits/master/) and then click any commit other than the first one.
You will see the exact substantive change made to the ToS with that commit hash
in the [actual repository](https://github.com/ChilloutVR-Team/docs) without churn caused by
reordering or renumbering.
